 *
 * \brief Implementing almass specific random number generation and probability distribution classes, based on/wrapping c ++ std library functionality. Boost library is not used anymore.
 * 
 * \section LICENSE
 *
 * \section DESCRIPTION
 * This files make it possible to use a simple syntax for generating random numbers from a specified distribution
 *
 * \section USAGE-A
 * Steps needed to use an almass probability distribution object  
 *
 * (1) Include the module header file
 *
 *            #include "ALMaSS_Random.h"
 *
 * (2) Define a "probability_distribution" object. Here are some examples:
 *
 *			  probability_distribution p1("DISCRETE", "1.0 2.5 4 5.1 7"); // weights for the variable number of outcomes {0,1,2,...}
 *			  probability_distribution p1("NORMAL", "1.0 3.0"); // mean and standard deviation 
 *			  probability_distribution p3("BETABINOMIAL", "14 2 1 0"); // Outcome max value, alpha, beta from binomial distribution, and the no_zero flag
 *			  probability_distribution p4("UNIREAL", "0 1");  // // [min,max)
 *			  probability_distribution p5("UNIREAL", "0 1");  // // [min.max]
 *
 *  (3) Use the probability distribution to make an random extraction. Here are some examples: 
 *
 *			  int x = p1.geti();   // or  int x = p1.get(); the casting from double to int is automatic
 *			  double x = p2.get();
 *	
 * \section USAGE-B
 * Steps needed to one of the generic random functions g_rand_uni(), g_rand_uni2() or g_rand_uni3() ( backward compatibility for some of the code, also common used distributions )
 *
 * (1) Include the module header file
 *
 *            #include "ALMaSS_Random.h"
 *
 * (2) Use the g_rand_uni()
 *
 *           double x = g_rand_uni();   // random real number between [0,1)
 */
